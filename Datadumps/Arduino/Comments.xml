I dont have specific knowledge of the ROM chips on the Arduino, but many ROMs have the ability of spreading read and write cycles across the chip. The effect of this is that when even some memory locations degrade, it is a sign that the entire chip will degrade soon. Even if the R/W cycles are not spread, even then, if certain areas start to fail, then it is a sign that.." CreationDate="2014-02-13T15:31:04.303" UserId="65" />
